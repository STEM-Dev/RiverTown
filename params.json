{"name":"Rivertown","tagline":"NetLogo model used for an Engineering module for pre-service teachers at Cal Poly","body":"RiverTown\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThis is an engineering water management exercise that allows the student to explore various options for water management around a community. \r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VicCastillo/RiverTown/master/RiverTown-Screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## HOW IT WORKS\r\n\r\nThere is a river on the far left hand side whose level is controlled by a slider. A dig/mound tool allows the user to remove soil to (dig) create a basin, trench, ditch, or other waterway; or to (mound) create dikes or river banks. \r\n\r\n## HOW TO USE IT\r\n\r\npress `setup` then `go`\r\nslowly increase the river level using the slider and observe\r\n\r\npress `setup` again\r\nswitch `mouse-tool?` on\r\nselect `dig` or `mound`\r\nuse the mouse to dig or mound\r\nslowly increase the river level using the slider and observe\r\n\r\n## THINGS TO NOTICE\r\n\r\nheadward erosion threatens the orphanage near the cliff\r\nsoil deposits are shown in red\r\n\r\n## THINGS TO TRY\r\n\r\nTry to prevent flooding of the town headward erosion while irrigating the crops\r\n\r\n## EXTENDING THE MODEL\r\n\r\nCrops could change depending on water conditions.\r\nHouses and orphanage could respond to flooding.\r\n\r\n## CREDITS AND REFERENCES\r\n\r\nRiverTown model\r\nJohn Keller and David Mitchell, \r\nCenter for Excellence in STEM Education\r\nCalifornia Polytech, San Luis Obispo, Ca\r\n\r\nDavid Mitchell, Vic Castillo, and John Keller, Saving Rivertown: Using Computer Simulations in an Earth Science Engineering Design Project for Pre-Service Teachers, 2015 ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Seattle, Wa.\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\nRiverTown Model.
